# Requirements

Only python requirement is to install the keen.io library

`pip install keen`

You also need to create a file called config.json and put it in the same directory as getBloomSky.py file.

# config.json format

```
{
  "bloomsky": {
    "api_key": "YOUR BLOOMSKY API KEY HERE"
  },
  "keen.io": {
    "write_key": "YOUR KEEN.IO WRITE KEY HERE",
    "project_id": "YOUR KEEN.IO PROJECT ID HERE"
  },
  "agent_name": "WHATEVER YOU ANT TO NAME YOUR BLOOMSKY"
}
```

That's it! ;)
